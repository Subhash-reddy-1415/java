# Simple Car Class in Java

## Description
This Java program demonstrates the concept of a class and object in Java. A class `Car` is defined with a method `drive()` that prints a message when called. An object of the `Car` class is created in the `Main` class and used to invoke the `drive()` method.

## Files
- `Car.java`: Contains the `Car` class with a `vehicle` field and `drive()` method.
- `Main.java`: Contains the `main()` method that creates an object of `Car` and calls `drive()`.

## How to Compile and Run
```bash
javac Car.java Main.java
java Main
Output
